//NOTES ON EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS
//Swift Expressions/Statements and code blocks
/*
 swift expressions:
 -expressions are a combo of variables, operators, literals, and functions to evaluate a single value
 - examples of expressions include variable assignments (var marks = 80) and comparisons (num1 == num2).
 swift statements
 -statements are instructions to perform a specific task
    1. simple statements- expressions or declarations
 Example: var score = 9 * 5
    2. conditional statements- executes blocks of code based on certain conditions
 ex:
 if (age > 18) {
   print("Can Vote")
 }
 Types include if...else and switch statements.
3. loop statements: repeatedly executes blocks of code
 ex.
 for i in 1...3 {
     print("Hello, World!")
 }
 Types include for-in, while, and repeat-while loops.
Swift Code Blocks
 - code block is a group of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`
 ex:
 if true { // start of block
   let sum = 2 + 3
   print("Result is \(sum)")
 } // end of block
code blocks define the scope of variables and the execution context
